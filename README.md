### Images

**IMPORTANT**: Image files **MUST NOT** contain spaces or else Cloudflare's ImageService will not load them properly. Why? I have no idea. But the power of trial and error has led me to this conclusion.

#### Formats

- `.jpeg` (**NOT** `.jpg`)
  - Use this format for normal images, especially ones with complex colors and transitions
- `.png`
  - Use this format for anything that has a transparent background. This will be for any screenshots or samples of your work on phones.
