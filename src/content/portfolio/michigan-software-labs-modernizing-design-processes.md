## Situation
During my nearly two years at Michigan Software Labs, I had the opportunity to transform the design department by introducing a user-centered design philosophy and implementing cross-functional team workshops to enhance product design and team collaboration. While I can't share specific projects due to confidentiality agreements, I can highlight one public project, Hearsee Mobility, which focused on creating an accessible navigation solution for visually impaired users, discussed in a dedicated case study. Beyond that, I want to share the broader story of how I helped revolutionize the design process at Michigan Software Labs and the valuable insights I gained as Design Manager.
## Company Overview
Michigan Software Labs is a software consultancy that partners with a diverse range of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, universities, and non-profits. During my tenure, I led design efforts on software solutions across various platforms, including IoT, iOS, Android, iPadOS, and Web. One particularly rewarding challenge was developing an IoT solution for a manufacturing client, where we successfully improved system reliability and user experience by simplifying complex workflows for factory operators. The projects we worked on spanned industries such as:
- Media streaming and content delivery
- Multimedia platform development
- Indoor positioning and navigation systems
- Educational technology for higher education institutions
- Online learning platforms and digital courseware
- Industrial automation and manufacturing process optimization
- Supply chain management and logistics solutions
- Accessible technology and inclusive design solution
## Transforming the Design Department
A significant part of my role focused on modernizing the design department, which initially faced challenges such as inconsistent processes, siloed efforts, and a lack of user-centered focus. To address these issues, I transformed our approach to user experience through initiatives like introducing product design, establishing design operations, incorporating design thinking, and restructuring the team. These efforts resulted in a more efficient, collaborative, and user-focused design process.
### Introducing Product Design
I implemented a product design philosophy that shifted our work to be more user-centered and holistic, ensuring we addressed the full scope of user needs while gaining greater client buy-in and involvement throughout the development process. As a concept that was new to the company and did not exist before my arrival, this required a cultural shift towards embracing a more integrated and user-focused design approach.
### Establishing Design Ops
I introduced a design operations framework to create consistent processes, improve collaboration, and scale our design capabilities effectively. As a new concept for the company that did not exist before my arrival, this initiative led to a 25% reduction in project delivery time and significantly improved cross-functional team alignment.
### Incorporating Design Thinking
I worked closely with leadership to embed design thinking into our software development practices, allowing us to tackle client challenges in a more structured and empathetic way. For example, by applying design thinking during a project for an indoor navigation solution, we were able to redefine the user journey, which led to increase in positive user testing feedback.
### Team Building and Restructuring
I rebuilt the design team by taking into account diversity, team cohesiveness, and filling skill gaps. This involved hiring individuals with a diverse range of skills and experiences to create a strong foundation that could meet the varied needs of our clients.
## Key Accomplishments
During my time at Michigan Software Labs, I led initiatives that significantly reshaped the design team's impact.
### Team Charter Development
Defined goals, values, and expectations to unify the design team and set clear expectations both internally and externally, aligning our design team with company objectives.
### Design Ops Implementation
Created consistent workflows, improved cross-functional alignment, and reduced project delivery time by 25%.
### Career Path Development
Created a four-track framework that addressed designers at all stages of their careers, defining roles and opportunities for growth within the team.
### User-Centered Product Design
Ensured our approach was always focused on user needs and the client's business requirements, leading to higher engagement, satisfaction, and stronger client relationships.
### Creative Team Techniques
Used improvisation in meetings and workshops to boost team creativity and collaboration.
## Reflection
The work we did at Michigan Software Labs spanned numerous industries and platforms, such as higher education, e-learning, and manufacturing, which were particularly challenging yet rewarding, showcasing our team's versatility and expertise. I am particularly proud of how we modernized our approach to user experience, shifting from individual efforts to a more collaborative, streamlined process. Implementing product design principles and design operations frameworks fundamentally transformed our design practice, allowing us to deliver high-quality, user-focused solutions more effectively.

My experience at Michigan Software Labs reinforced my belief in the power of design thinking, the importance of structured processes, and the value of a diverse, cohesive design team. Although I can't discuss specific project details, the positive impact we had is evident in the frameworks and methodologies we put in place, resulting in increased efficiency, improved user feedback, and enhanced product quality, illustrating the role of thoughtful, strategic design leadership.
