## Situation

OmniGraffle is a vector based diagramming and digital illustration application for macOS and iOS. Creative director for end-to-end redesign, including managing the research and design operations. Managed a team of UX designers, UI designers, and researchers.

## Task

The focus of the V7 redesign was to empower and support the creative professionals' use of OmniGraffle by building efficiencies and streamlining their most common interactions with the application.  The OmniGraffle version 7.0 release included the following efficiencies and improvements:

- Artboards
- Bezier Point Editing Tool Improvements
- Convert Lines To Shapes
- Convert Text To Shapes
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- New Onboarding Experience

### Rising Action

For the release of OmniGraffle 7.0, I led UX team engaged in research to gain insight into what OmniGraffle customers were currently requesting and what their current pain points were within the application. The UX team worked very closely with Omni's software engineers and shared our findings and results of this research. This collaboration helped my team consider technical limitations and possibilities we may have otherwise overlooked.

### Climax

Here's some short summaries of what we worked on:

1. **Artboards**: An innovative feature that treated artboards like layers, introducing flexibility and efficiency to the user experience. Users were able to define areas for toolbar buttons, export images of varying resolutions, and contain objects in a project with ease. Furthermore, any shape—square, circle, triangle, or octagon—could be transformed into an artboard.
2. **Bezier Point Editing Tool Improvements**: We made it easier for users to add or subtract vector points without navigating to a different tool. This speedier, more streamlined process improved the drag-out control response for vector points for a more intuitive design process.
3. **Convert Lines and Text to Shapes**: This was a much-requested feature. We enabled the transformation of strokes and text into shapes, a straightforward experience that preserved the shape's aesthetics with as few vector points as possible. This change was efficiently integrated into the menu command within the edit menu.
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: We improved navigation and usage ease by relocating keyboard shortcuts to a modal window accessible from the OmniGraffle menu. Tools and menus were clearly listed for accessibility and single key functionality was introduced. In case of conflicting shortcuts, a warning icon would alert the user.
5. **New Onboarding:** In response to lower download-to-trial conversion rates from the Mac App Store compared to our website, we revamped OmniGraffle 7.0's first-run onboarding experience. This comprised of a brief video highlighting the application's functionalities in an accessible, illustrative style, a regularly updated "What's New" section for users to keep track of the latest features, and a comprehensive walkthrough section to smoothly introduce the application's interface and essential features to new users. These strategic improvements led to a significant increase in our download-to-trial conversion rates - 23% on the App Store and 16% on our website, bolstering OmniGraffle 7.0's success.

### Falling Action

The process of implementing the artboard layers presented more technical challenges than I anticipated, indicating my need for a more profound understanding of OmniGraffle's drawing model to guide my UX team better. Despite my design background, I learned not to take granted functionalities of artboards in the redesign. I needed to educate the development team on the value of artboards for designers – explaining their importance as work containers. By breaking down the concept into simple terms using poster board, sketches, and a large table, I could effectively convey the importance of artboards in enhancing the designers' workflow. This experience was crucial in learning the importance of cross-team education and the interdependencies of design and technical development.

## Result (Conclusion)

OmniGraffle 7 for Mac was the second most successful OmniGraffle release in the history of the application. For three months, sales of the application beat OmniGraffle 6 for the same time frame. It was a top-10 grossing app on the App Store for seven weeks. In the three years since the release, OmniGraffle 7 Pro has been Omni's top-grossing application in The Omni store and on the Mac App Store.
