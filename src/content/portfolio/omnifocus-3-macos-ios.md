## Situation

OmniFocus, a leading task management app, was due for a major update to address evolving user needs and stay competitive in the market. As a key player in the development of version 3, I worked closely with the CEO and product manager to determine the scope of the release. Our goal was to address user feedback, such as the need for more flexible tagging and better calendar integration, enhance functionality, and improve the user experience across Mac and iOS platforms.
## Task
My responsibilities included:
**Team Leadership & Strategy**
- Leading the user experience team in redesigning the application
- Developing design strategy and overseeing operations
- Managing a team of 5 designers and researchers
**Research & Creative Direction**
- Crafting and directing research initiatives
- Providing UX/UI creative direction
**Collaboration & Quality Assurance**
- Collaborating with QA and Support to coordinate user feedback and bug reports

We identified four key areas for improvement based on user feedback and analytics:
1. Replacing contexts with tags (Mac and iOS)
2. Enhancing custom perspectives (Mac and iOS)
3. Improving calendar visualization in the Forecast perspective (Mac and iOS)
4. Introducing customizable inspectors (iOS only)
## Action
### Replacing Contexts with Tags
We replaced "contexts" with "tags" to align with user expectations, as users expressed a desire for more flexible ways to categorize tasks beyond the limitations of a single context. To enhance the interface:
- Created tag iconography for consistent branding.
- Used capsule shapes for tags in the outline view for better readability.
- Managed tag clutter with an ellipsis/more tag system.

### Enhancing Custom Perspectives

For power users, we enhanced the perspective filter engine by leveraging the macOS predicate editor framework, which provides a user-friendly way to create advanced filtering rules. This expansion allowed users to customize their workflows more effectively, offering greater flexibility and control over task management.

### Improving Calendar Visualization
We integrated calendar events into the Forecast perspective's outline view, interleaving them with action items. Calendar events were differentiated using the user's calendar app color, reducing friction and improving action-event association. For example, users could easily distinguish between meetings and tasks at a glance, making it simpler to plan their day and avoid scheduling conflicts.

### Customizable Inspectors (iOS)

To reduce cognitive load, we designed customizable inspectors, allowing users to rearrange, hide, and prioritize options according to their preferences. This flexibility provided a tailored experience, enabling users to focus on the most relevant information while minimizing distractions and streamlining their workflows.

## Result
OmniFocus 3 launched to overwhelmingly positive feedback:
1. **User adoption:**
    - Daily active users increased by 12% on Mac and 17% on iOS, compared to a 5% growth rate for the previous version.
    - OmniFocus 3 for iOS remained a top-25 grossing app for six weeks in the App Store, whereas the previous version only achieved this for three weeks.
    - OmniFocus 3 for Mac held a top-25 position for four weeks, doubling the duration of the prior version.
2. **Media reception:**
    - Rosemary Orchard from MacStories praised the release:

> "This release represents a substantial upgrade that has brought more control to my system and will keep me, and many others, committed OmniFocus users far into the future."

The success of OmniFocus 3 highlighted our team's ability to understand user needs, implement complex features, and deliver a significantly improved product, solidifying OmniFocus's position as a leading task management solution. One key lesson learned was the importance of incorporating direct user feedback early in the design process, which helped us prioritize impactful features. Additionally, fostering close collaboration between design, development, and support teams ensured a seamless user experience and timely response to user issues.
