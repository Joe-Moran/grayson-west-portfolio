title: Wireframing First
summary: "
<h4>Situation</h4>
<p>Upon joining Michigan Software Labs, I identified a premature focus on high-fidelity wireframes obscuring effective development, particularly in the Hearsee project.</p>

<h4>Task</h4>
<p>Implemented a collaborative, iterative workflow, bridging the gap between design and engineering teams, reducing cognitive overhead, and fostering innovation.
</p>

<h4>Result</h4>  
<p>This approach increased adaptability, allowed swifter changes, and reduced complexities in design changes. Our project efficiency soared, illustrating the value of a flexible, low-fidelity early stage design process in improving project outcomes.
