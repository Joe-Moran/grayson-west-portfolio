title: Design Team Charter
summary: When I joined the Michigan Software Labs design team, I noticed the lack of a team charter. I proposed creating one to establish a foundation for our work and team identity. Through off-site discussions, we defined our role, strengths, and aspirations. We outlined how we work, set team commitments, aligned with company values, and identified growth areas. This resulted in a high-level team charter, signed by all members and displayed in our workspace. The charter consolidated our identity, fostered a shared vision, and strengthened our team culture.

When I first joined the Michigan Software Labs design practice, I was struck be the absence of some kind statement of purpose or team charter that would act as foundation for how we approached our work and our place within the company. I proposed to the leadership and the team the idea of crafting a team charter. My past experience and research highlighted the importance of a foundational document to help foster team identity and cohesion, defining expectations, and establishing a shared vision.

We initiated a series of discussions during day long off site meeting and addressed what we believe is the Design Practice's role at Michigan Software Labs. These discussions helped us answer crucial questions about our role within the organization, our strengths, and what we aspire to be known for. During the day we spent time discussing and formulating the following:

### How We Work

It is essential to understand and define the nature of our current and ideal future work. We also identified the type of work that we don't want to do.

### Team Commitments

We established behavioral and performance expectations for each team member. This exercise allowed us to create a safe, supportive, and active feedback culture, ensuring transparent and efficient work status updates.

### How We Conduct Our Business

We delved into how our team aligns with the company's core values, collaborates with customers, and supports business objectives. We also explored our role during conflicts and ways to maintain team health. An essential part of this process was understanding how we measure our success, manage work handoffs, and uphold our personal and company's design values.

### Identifying Areas for Growth and Improvement

We outlined our team's areas that require further development and experience. Identifying these growth opportunities not only allows individual growth but ensures we're robustly supporting our organization's evolving goals.

The completion of these conversations and reflections led us to the creation of our team charter: a high-level document articulating our purpose, commitments, focus areas, growth zones, and business conduct norms. Once the charter was finalized, it was signed by all team members and shared with the rest of the company. We also decided to display it physically in our workspace. Psychically displaying it meant that anyone who entered our space was acquainted with who we are, what we stand for, and what guides our actions from that point forward.

## Conclusion

The introduction of the team charter to the organization was instrumental in consolidating our identity. It also guided the establishment of a shared vision, enabling us to work more effectively towards shared goals and mutual growth. The creation of the team charter at Michigan Software Labs helped to reinforce the design practice’s identity and unified our direction towards a shared vision—ultimately fostering a strong, committed, and innovative team culture.
