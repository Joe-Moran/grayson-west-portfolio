## Situation
Landstar System, Inc. is a transportation services company that operates without owning assets. It relies on a network of independent agents and third-party providers to offer logistics and transportation services. Although the company's services are primarily offered in the United States, it also provides some international coverage. Landstar offers various services, including truckload, less-than-truckload, flatbed, expedited, and intermodal transport.

Landstar faced a significant challenge in managing compliance with its agents and providers. The current process needed to be updated and primarily manual, making it challenging to maintain compliance, which is legally required to ensure the safety of operations, minimize environmental impact and protect the company's reputation and financial standing. Drivers had to submit compliance information in handwritten form, which had to be scanned or photographed before being emailed or faxed to Landstar, leading to delays and possible errors. Additionally, the Compliance team at Landstar had to use multiple different applications to manage and process compliance reports, making it a complex and laborious process.
## Task
Landstar System, Inc. approached Michigan Software Labs intending to develop a digital solution to streamline their time-consuming and labor-intensive compliance report management process. I created a well-defined product design plan to tackle Landstar's challenges and set project objectives. As the design leader overseeing the execution of the work, I ensured that each member's skills were utilized effectively and encouraged a collaborative work environment. Working with the product manager and clients, we developed a comprehensive product plan from scratch, combining robust functionality with user-centric design to simplify the once-complex compliance management process. Throughout the project, I merged my leadership, strategy development, and innovative design thinking to ideate and introduce a streamlined digital solution that transformed Landstar's compliance report management process for both web and mobile platforms.

**Web-based Application**:
The purpose of the web-based application is to facilitate the Landstar compliance team with the ability to:
1. Create compliance reports
2. Collect compliance reports
3. Manage compliance reports
4. Validate compliance reports

**Mobile Application Update**:
To facilitate more Compliance reporting from agents and providers, we created a plan to add compliance functionality to the  existing Landstar One iOS and Android application to:
1. Implement compliance report functionality into Landstar One
2. Enable Business Capacity Owners (BCOs) to submit compliance reports via the mobile application.
### Rising Action
After being tasked with streamlining Landstar's compliance report management process, Michigan Software Labs conducted thorough user and technical research.

**User Research**:
The project required a deep understanding of regulatory compliance and how it was implemented at Landstar. The team conducted interviews with employees who were responsible for processing compliance reports and those who would be using the new application. Additionally, they collaborated with the executive team at Landstar to understand the business requirements that the application needed to fulfill.

**Technical Research**:
Attention was drawn to the Landstar technology infrastructure, which included several outdated systems. This required a thorough analysis of technical aspects to determine any limitations that could affect the user experience. The compliance department depended on nine separate systems, while email was a key tool for communication and delivery, which Landstar wished to preserve. As a result, the team investigated the feasibility of incorporating email into the new technology system.

**Key Findings and Learnings**:
The research provided valuable insights for the project:
1. It revealed that processing compliance reports required navigating between four to five different platforms, primarily via email, indicating a fragmented workflow. A single PMR report, for instance, necessitated 24 specific actions.
2. Specialized teams primarily managed each compliance report type with little to no role overlap.
3. Each type of compliance report was handled through separate email queues and addresses.
4. Landstar's management expressed the need for a centralized system to view all reports, tie in with existing tools for better trend recognition, and unify the diverse compliance departments into a single influential group.
5. Users were under significant cognitive load with the need to understand and remember the specifics of each system they interacted with.
6. Notwithstanding the complexities, users were comfortable with email-based interactions, adding familiarity to the process.
7. Users were highly eager for an improved user experience that would reduce the time they spent processing compliance issues.
### Climax
Based on our research, we devised a solution to tackle Landstar's compliance management issues. Our product idea is a task management application designed to simplify their current system's complexities. The application will have a structured, inbox-style interface that consolidates the necessary tasks.

**Core Proposal**:
The proposed solution was a web application mimicking the familiar layout of an email inbox that could integrate seamlessly with Landstar's existing tech stack. It offered a unified platform for users to receive, process, and manage compliance reports. More importantly, users would no longer have to juggle multiple platforms and systems.

**Central Features and Benefits**:
1. Quick Triage: Users could immediately view new compliance tasks upon arrival, enabling swift triage and prioritization based on urgency and complexity.
2. Increased Productivity: With features like prioritization, scheduling, and reminders, users can focus on what needs to be done next without wasting time determining priorities or remembering deadlines, leading to more efficient use of time.
3. Improved Organization: By reviewing and categorizing tasks, users could decide their priorities, timelines, and compliance categories.
4. Prevents Task from Being Overlooked: One inbox for all compliance issues reduced the chances of essential tasks slipping through the cracks.
5. Collaborative Space: Users could work collaboratively on tasks, bringing in a second set of eyes if needed.

**Advanced Details**:
The proposed application would integrate with Landstar's different systems, enabling it to receive all compliance reports in a single queue, filter them by type, hold in-app communication, and reduce a once 24-action process into a lean, time-saving operation. Notifications help users stay on top of tasks.

**Key Benefits for Compliance Users**:
1. Improved Task Creation and Management: The app would facilitate task creation, setting deadlines, and assigning priorities.
2. Effective Categorization: Users could categorize reports into focused groups, easing report handling.
3. Scheduling and Reminders: Users could schedule compliance issues for specific dates and times and receive reminders to ensure deadlines were met.
5. Stress Reduction: Clear compliance task organization and visibility would reduce anxiety around missing obligations or deadlines. Also, not having to navigate the myriad of systems they previously did would significantly reduce stress.
6. Flexibility: Users can customize compliance organization and views according to their work style.
### Falling Action
Upon completing and consolidating our thorough research, extensive planning, and strategic design ideas, I communicated our proposal to the Landstar executive team. The presentation outlined the product design plan, which included views of Landstar's compliance management challenges, flexible solutions for the web and mobile platforms, and the benefits it would bring to Landstar. 

I received a positive response for the concept, thoughtful approach, and rigorous analysis I presented. The product manager was particularly impressed and asked, "How quickly can we ship this?" This showed that my leadership, strategic planning and design efforts were successful. It was a triumphant moment for our project and boosted my confidence.
## Result (Conclusion)
In the latter part of 2023, we launched our application into its public beta phase. The initial reception has been overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the application's effectiveness and user-friendly design. Preliminary tests have already shown impressive efficiency improvements, with the compliance team reducing their compliance ticket completion time by a substantial 18 percent. For me, this project was a tangible success and a gratifying journey. The complexity of the challenge, coupled with the creative autonomy entrusted by the client, made this endeavor a thoroughly enriching and rewarding experience.
