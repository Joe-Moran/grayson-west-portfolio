## Situation
When I joined Michigan Software Labs, the company lacked clear definitions for design roles. This absence of structure led to confusion about expectations for designers working on projects. The design team consisted of both experienced and novice designers. Simultaneously, I was working to introduce the concept of product design to the company.

Traditionally, designers at the company were responsible for overseeing both product design and UX design aspects of a project. This dual responsibility often required designers to context-switch between these two disciplines throughout the day. While experienced designers could manage this effectively, younger or less experienced designers found it challenging to navigate these role transitions.

Recognizing the need for clarity and structure, I decided to create comprehensive role definitions that would not only distinguish between product design and UX design but also incorporate the emerging concept of product design within our organization.
## Task
To address the confusion and provide clearer guidance for our design team, I undertook the task of creating comprehensive role definitions. My goal was to establish clear guidelines outlining what, how, why, and when designers at our company should perform specific tasks when working on projects.

These role definitions were intended to serve multiple purposes:
1. Improve operational efficiency on projects
2. Enhance collaboration among designers
3. Facilitate better interactions with project team members from other disciplines

Ultimately, I wanted to provide my team with a clear understanding of what was expected of them when working on projects. In essence, they needed a roadmap to guide their operations and decision-making processes.
### Rising Action
To begin the task of creating well-defined roles, I implemented a collaborative approach that involved various stakeholders within the company. This process consisted of several key steps:
1. **Consulting the Design Team**: 
   I asked my team of designers to create bullet-point lists detailing what they believed should be expected of them when working on a project. This exercise helped capture their perspectives and current understanding of their roles.
2. **Engaging Project Managers**:
   I worked closely with project managers to:
   - Understand how they viewed design within the scope of project management
   - Gather their ideas and opinions on how designers should operate
   - Identify any gaps between project management expectations and current design practices
3. **Collaborating with Software Engineers**:
   I held discussions with software engineers to:
   - Gain insight into their perceptions of how designers were functioning\
   - Understand their expectations and needs from the design team\
   - Identify opportunities for improving collaboration between design and development
This approach allowed me to gather comprehensive insights from different perspectives, ensuring that the role definitions would address the needs and expectations of all team members involved in our projects.
