During my childhood and teenage years, I spent a lot of time in the theater culture because my mother ran a community theater. I took theater classes and acted in high school, where I fell in love with improvisation techniques. Years later, as a people leader, I wondered if these techniques could be used to create a unique coaching strategy for my team.

Recently, I observed some of my younger team members struggling with public speaking and insecurity when presenting their work. As UX designers, confidently expressing their ideas is essential to their job. I decided to use my theater background and incorporate improv techniques to help my team develop more confidence.

To keep the stakes low and ensure that the exercises were directly relatable to our design work, we chose specific exercises. For example:

- We used the "Yes, And..." technique in our brainstorming and post-mortem sessions to foster a culture of collaboration. Each member learned to accept and build upon the ideas of others.
- The Character Creation exercise was another favorite, where the team members conjured a unique character, similar to the development of user personas in our design projects. This exercise's direct tie-in with our work helped solidify its importance.
- For usability testing, we tried the Object Work exercise, where the team mimed or used imaginary objects, resulting in superior demonstration and understanding of product features.
- Lastly, Environment Building aided us in mapping out user flows effectively by creating scenarios for product-use situations.

I've witnessed a significant improvement in my team members' confidence in speaking publicly and presenting their work. By introducing improv exercises, we've discovered an effective way to develop necessary professional skills while creating a relaxed, playful environment that fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. Over time, these sessions also had the unanticipated benefit of increasing team unity and uplifting overall morale. These sessions were just as much about fun as they were about learning.
