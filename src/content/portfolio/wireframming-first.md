## Card Text
Situation  
Upon joining Michigan Software Labs, I identified a premature focus on high-fidelity wireframes obscuring effective development, particularly in the Hearsee project.
  
Task  
Implemented a collaborative, iterative workflow, bridging the gap between design and engineering teams, reducing cognitive overhead, and fostering innovation.
  
Result  
This approach increased adaptability, allowed swifter changes, and reduced complexities in design changes. Our project efficiency soared, illustrating the value of a flexible, low-fidelity early stage design process in improving project outcomes.

## Situation:
When I joined Michigan Software Labs, I noticed that the product teams tended to focus on high-fidelity wireframes too early in the development process. This was especially evident in the Hearsee project. To address this, we implemented a collaborative and iterative approach to our workflow, which resulted in significant improvements in our product development trajectory. The insights we gained from this process also led to changes across the company, improving overall project efficiency and operational effectiveness.
## Task:
As outlined in the Hearsee Case Study, the project involved building software for both mobile and web platforms. When I joined the team, most of the mobile work had already been completed and was ready for development.
## Issues:
Despite having completed a significant portion of the design work, there was a noticeable disconnect between the design and engineering teams. This led to operational challenges, as client expectations were set before the developers started working on the project. The team's strict adherence to the initial designs generated unnecessary cognitive overhead during feature discussions and hindered potential creative solutions. This situation created a less-than-ideal environment for innovative collaboration, which we learned from and noted for future projects.
## Transformation:
While experimenting with low-fidelity wireframes, we discovered significant benefits. They allowed us to rapidly iterate on ideas and make real-time adjustments during discussions. Avoiding premature high-fidelity design helped prevent a ripple effect of changes across the application, which streamlined our process. This experience has underscored the value of low-fidelity and has been pivotal in shaping our future design strategies.
## The Impact:
Based on our experiences, I presented the benefits of employing low-fidelity wireframes in the project development process to the entire company. I pointed out that focusing on implementation before delving into detailed polishing can conserve resources and prevent unnecessary high-fidelity redesigns, especially if a strategic pivot becomes necessary. Moreover, maintaining designs with low fidelity encourages flexibility and adaptability among developers. It also promotes a culture of active collaboration and careful planning between designers and developers.
## Result (Conclusion):
Michigan Software Labs has seen concrete improvements since adopting this more flexible project model that utilizes wireframes. We've become more adaptable and capable of implementing changes swiftly, sometimes even in real-time, during meetings, leading to getting design work in front of clients faster and into the hands of users sooner. By reducing the reliance on high-fidelity designs during the early stages, we have streamlined design changes and reduced complexities, thereby increasing our overall project efficiencies.
