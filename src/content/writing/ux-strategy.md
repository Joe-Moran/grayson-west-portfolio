## Summary
Creating a compelling UX strategy that inspires the team is essential to team and company success. I advocate the my designers get direct access to stakeholders so that they can better understand the problems the need to solve in order to craft amazing user experiences and drive business outcomes. Establishing a robust UX interview framework, working closely with internal teams to improve design processes, and consistent use of wireframes are some of the key elements of my strategy. To maintain a competitive advantage, I advocate for market research and identification of indicator metrics to continuously measure and improve UX effectiveness.

As a design leader, it is my responsibility to create a compelling and effective User Experience (UX) strategy vision. I believe that UX strategy is a critical component of Design Operations and sets the direction for the organization. It is not just about mapping out the strategy but also about inspiring the team involved.

I think that designers should have direct access to stakeholders who influence the product design direction, such as executives, product managers, marketing teams, sales, customer support, and engineers. I firmly believe that when designers connect with users and decision-makers, it leads to a better user experience and better business outcomes.

A vital part of the UX strategy I endorse involves establishing a robust UX interview framework. These interviews help designers delve into understanding the needs of the people for whom they are designing. It is equally crucial to comprehend the product vision from the perspective of business stakeholders. Designers must have a balanced understanding of both the business and user needs, which collectively drive a user-centric approach.

My strategy also includes working closely with internal stakeholders and teams to grasp how design is executed at the operational level within the company, soliciting suggestions for improvement. Part of this process involves identifying roadblocks and friction in the design process and taking measures to ease them in collaboration with development, sales, support, business, and marketing teams.

I advocate for the consistent use of wireframes as they help identify usability gaps and act as bridges between design intent and user needs. Wireframes play a pivotal role in translating abstract ideas into tangible experiences.

To strengthen the link between design and development, I work with the development team to surface and improve any friction within our collaborative cycle. I also ensure that the design team has access to customer feedback channels and encourage the creation of a UX research framework that allows us to filter, analyze, and act upon customer feedback.

To maintain and improve our product's value proposition over time, it is vital to discern the competitive landscape through market research and analyze competitors' offerings. It enables us to understand user choices and derive inspiration to shape our unique value proposition.

An inherent part of my strategy is to identify indicator metrics, continuously measuring and iteratively improving the UX effectiveness. Using both qualitative and quantitative metrics provides a holistic view of the user experience, which is illuminated by analyzing key performance indicators such as task completion rates, error rates, user satisfaction surveys, and usability testing results.
