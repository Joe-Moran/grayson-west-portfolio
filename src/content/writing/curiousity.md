I am an immensely curious individual. My early influences and experiences, particularly my involvement in the underground punk scene during my teenage years and my pursuit of trying to become professional cyclist, has shaped my thirst for knowledge and the constant pursuit of the possible and impossible. The punk movement of the 80s embraced a spirit of rebellion and tireless questioning of societal norms, teaching me to be open-minded, adventurous, and persistent. It instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity of opinion. The ethos I found in the music of The Dead Kennedy's, Agent Orange, and T.S.O.L cemented my willingness to embrace change and to seek continuous evolution.

I relish diving into complex problems, even at the risk of possibly failing. This inclination was mirrored in my competitive cycling journey as a youth and young adult. Seeing the Tour de France on TV fueled my determination to pursue European bicycle racing - an aspiration met initially with laughter but led to an unforgettable two-year competition stint in Belgium and the Netherlands. These undertakings reiterated that fear should never hinder the path of curiosity and what might be possible.

Guided by my curiosity, I am driven to unearth learning opportunities. This thirst for knowledge propels me to intricately ponder life's puzzles, from the strategic complexities of board games to the overwhelming enormities of real-world predicaments. Far from daunting, these challenges excite me, compelling me to understand and innovate solutions. This intellectual exploration journey sparks my creativity and fosters unique insights that I delight in employing in remarkable and unique ways.

I deeply value a collaborative atmosphere filled with like-minded, equally curious individuals. I appreciate those who, like me, are unafraid to question the norm, explore new ideas and directions, and find joy in understanding our work more deeply. People who perceive challenges as growth opportunities, who bring a mix of creativity and knowledge to the table, who are aware of their environments, and who adapt to change with agility are individuals I admire and wish to collaborate with.

As a people leader, I aspire to establish environments that inspire curiosity, provide room for gathering knowledge, and encourage open communication. Just as my experiences with punk lifestyle and cycling shaped my thinking, I desire for all of us to fuel each other's curiosity, promote exploration, encourage mutual understanding, and ultimately embark on a thrilling journey of discovery together.
