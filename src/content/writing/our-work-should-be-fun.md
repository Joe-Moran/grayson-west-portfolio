title: Creating Productive Teams
summary: Work should be challenging—but it should also be fun.
  
  I’ve never believed that creativity thrives in silence. Some of the best ideas I’ve seen came from laughter, debate, or an unexpected side tangent in a team meeting. I lead with the belief that teams do their best work when they feel safe, supported, and free to try weird things. If the room feels flat, something’s off. If there’s energy, momentum follows.

As a designer leader, I endeavor to create environments where our work is engaging, aspirational, and, most importantly, fun. We dedicate such a significant portion of our lives to our careers that we should get some joy and pleasure from the work we all do. The people I lead are free to express their passions, leverage their creativity, and be their true selves.

Creating a fun environment in a design department means creating a space where individuals have the freedom to experiment, learn, and grow without fear of failure. This creates a safe space that embraces people for who they are, creatively and personally and establishes a department that is run on the principles of inclusivity and shared purpose. Over time, a culture where diverse inputs and fresh ideas are encouraged and celebrated evolves. 

I am driven to build teams of enthusiastic, passionate individuals who take pride in their craft, which benefits them and the companies for which they work. I aim to bring together a combination of passion, creativity, and imagination that defines the design industry and inspires us all. I encourage the people I lead to be active participants with me in creating a shared work environment that is fulfilling and meaningful for the group and the business. 

Engaging in enjoyable activities is fundamental for a well-rounded and fulfilling professional and personal life. Embracing fun fosters a spirit of adventure, encourages exploration, and sparks curiosity, which are vital components for continuous learning, fostering creativity, and producing groundbreaking innovations and products.
