title: Collaboration
summary: Throughout my 18 years of experience in software design, I have noticed that collaborative environments that bring together individuals with diverse perspectives tend to foster an atmosphere of creativity, innovation, and growth. When people from different backgrounds and with different skill sets work together, they can bring unique insights to the table, leading to innovative ideas and solutions that may not have been possible otherwise.

Successful software development within a product team depends on the collaboration of every team member without fear or hesitation. During my time at The Omni Group, I witnessed the positive outcomes of working together towards a common goal. As we developed some of the first iPhone apps, all product teams came together over four months to tackle the challenge of a new way of interacting with technology. We had no one to guide us through the process of translating our Mac apps to the iPhone, which required us to work collaboratively.

This experience taught me the importance of fostering a culture of collaboration where everyone's ideas are heard. Doing so encourages creative problem-solving and innovation. Diverse perspectives help to create out-of-the-box solutions that drive growth for the product and business outcomes. Collaboration can inspire a massive amount of creativity and create an exciting dynamic team environment of new ideas and possibilities.

At Michigan Software Labs, I have championed increased collaboration with leadership, my people leader peers, and my team. I accomplished this by leading by example, in team meetings, company presentations, and other ways. This resulted in a product team environment where all members felt free to voice their opinions and give feedback about the work my design team produced. This approach helped raise the mindset of the company's product teams and enabled them to deliver more in-depth features to our clients.
