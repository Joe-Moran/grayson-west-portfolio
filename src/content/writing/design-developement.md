Digital product design exists at the crossroads of creativity and functionality. To thrive in this space, designers must learn as much about development as possible. This is about more than mastering programming languages but constantly educating themself's about the basics of the frameworks, languages, and processes our engineering counterparts use in their work. This is uncharted territory for many designers and design teams to explore. Still, based on my experience, it can lead to drastically improved product team relationships, product outcomes, and business results.

I urge my designers to take every opportunity to mingle with developers. I coach them to listen attentively, ask questions in meetings, review the specifics of programming, and read technical documentation to increase their foundational understanding and technical language. A sense of development is a powerful aid in communicating their work to their teammates and internal stakeholders. As AI and automation become increasingly common, understanding these development concepts will become increasingly essential and help designers be adaptive, agile, and ready for future technological change.

As designers gain more development knowledge and communicate closely with developers, they contribute to building team spirit. This collaboration helps drive the product toward a unified direction. By understanding how their work is executed, designers become more effective at advocating for the user and their design. The entire product development process can lead to better work and harmonious collaboration between designers and developers.
