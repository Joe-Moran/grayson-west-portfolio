title: I Believe In Humans
summary: Believing in boundless human potential, derived from personal experiences, is my driving force. I learned about nurturing potential from my mother, a theater director. Her passion for fostering talent and unlocking latent creativity profoundly impacted me. My time as a competitive cyclist in Europe reinforced the power of collective effort over individual triumph. I'm fascinated by human curiosity, problem-solving abilities, imagination, and above all, passion. As a leader, my mission is not only acknowledging these qualities but also nurturing growth, guided by lessons learned from my mentors. Now, I aim to pay it forward.

Humans are capable of achieving more than they think possible. This belief comes from my own life experiences, things I've seen and learned, and my unshakeable faith in what humans are capable of—being curious, driven, and having endless potential. People can achieve amazing things when a space is created for them to tap into their talents and passions freely.

My mother was an extraordinary theater director. I witnessed firsthand the joy she derived from helping artists tap into their latent creativity, pushing the boundaries they never thought they could transcend. Many a weeknight, I would sit in her theater seats during her rehearsals. I was supposed to be doing my homework, but I would be transfixed by watching her interact, coach, and inspire her actors. I did not know it then, but her passion for fostering talent had a lasting impact on my life, empowering me to understand that leadership is about nurturing potential.

During my time as a competitive cyclist in Europe, I learned the significance of collaboration and teamwork that people are capable of. Winning a bike race was not about racing individually; nine teammates joined as a unified force to get one person to the finish line first. This is why I strongly believe in the potential of teams. United teams can solve seemingly impossible problems. There is immense power in unity, power in the collective whereby the sum is more significant than its parts.

Humans fascinate me with their curiosity, problem-solving abilities, and boundless imaginations. But most of all, their passion. Passion can fuel dreams, incite revolutions, and create marvels. As a leader, I aspire to tap into this latent fuel that exists in all of us.

It's not just about acknowledging the qualities of humans; it's also about contributing to their growth and development that keeps me coming to work every day—a commitment driven by the invaluable lessons I've learned from mentors who guided me along my path. Now, I want to pass this on to others.
