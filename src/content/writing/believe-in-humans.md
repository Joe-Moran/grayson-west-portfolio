Humans are capable of achieving far more than they believe possible. This conviction comes from my own life experiences, things I've seen and learned, and my unshakeable faith in human potential—our curiosity, drive, and boundless capacity. People can achieve extraordinary things when given the space to freely tap into their talents and passions.

My mother was an extraordinary theater director. I witnessed firsthand the joy she derived from helping artists tap into their latent creativity, pushing past boundaries they never thought they could transcend. Many weeknights, I would sit in the theater seats during her rehearsals. I was supposed to be doing my homework, but I was often transfixed by watching her interact with, coach, and inspire her actors. I didn't know it then, but her passion for fostering talent left a lasting impact on me, teaching me that true leadership is about nurturing potential.

During my time as a competitive cyclist in Europe, I learned the importance of collaboration and teamwork. Winning a bike race wasn't about individual effort; it took nine teammates working together as a unified force to get one person across the finish line first. This is why I believe so strongly in the potential of teams. United teams can solve seemingly impossible problems. There is immense power in unity—in the collective—where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Humans fascinate me with their curiosity, problem-solving abilities, and limitless imaginations. But most of all, I am inspired by their passion. Passion fuels dreams, incites revolutions, and creates wonders. As a leader, I aspire to tap into this latent fuel that exists within all of us.
