As a designer leader, I want to be part of teams and create teams where our shared work is engaging, aspirational, and, most importantly, fun. We should derive joy and satisfaction from our work, which we dedicate such a significant portion of our lives; I champion the idea that each of us should utilize our time at work as a platform to express our passion, leverage our creativity to make a fantastic product and be the person we aspire to be.

Having a fun environment in a design department means creating a space where individuals have the freedom to experiment, learn, and grow without fear of judgment or failure. This creates a safe space that embraces people for who they are, creatively and personally and establishes a department that is run on the principles of inclusivity and shared purpose. It is a culture where diverse inputs and fresh ideas are encouraged and celebrated and a system that fosters professional development by consistently learning and evolving in our fields. Infusing fun into our professions means profound enjoyment, inciting contentment, and a genuine sense of happiness.

I am driven to build teams of enthusiastic, passionate individuals who take pride in their craft. This benefits not only them but also the companies for which they work. I aim to bring together a combination of passion, creativity, and imagination that defines the design industry and inspires us all. Enjoyable design environments are created by engaging design activities that are so absorbing that we lose track of time while catching up on the joy of creation. Simultaneously, these activities should challenge us and propel our spirit of innovation, sparking curiosity and the desire for achievement.

I want my teammates to be active participants with me in creating a shared work environment that is fulfilling and meaningful for the group. Fun is essential to such experiences, as it encourages adventure, exploration, and curiosity, all integral to learning, creativity, and innovative products. As a design leader, I aspire to create environments where fun is a fundamental element that drives creativity and fosters growth and development.
